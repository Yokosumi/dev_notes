remember to use return -> check if the function is of type void (it doesn't return a value in that case)  
  
the reduce method can take two parameters the first one is for the callback function the second accesses the array  
  
you can create classes with static class methods that can be used outside of instances  
  
with following code you can check if a value is numeric:

```JavaScript
/^\d+$/.test(value)  
```

you can also check if the value only consists of letter:

```JavaScript
/^[A-Za-z]+$/.test(value)
```
  
you can access the last index of a string with:

```JavaScript
string[string.length - 1]
```

you can find out the length of a number by turning it into a string:

```JavaScript
const numberToString = string.toString()
const lengthOfNumber = numberToString.length // returns the length of the value

```
